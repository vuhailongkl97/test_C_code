testing LOCK in Linux's file

we can use fcntl to get "lock's status" and write "lock" to file

this mechanism is used in communicate between process when they access to same files


in this example:
1. write_lock.c :
    check lock status
    if ( lock hasn't locked)
        write lock to file with fcntl
        keep log 100s . after the process terminated -> lock auto is freed
    else
        return message

 2. read lock check status and report status to user via printf func
